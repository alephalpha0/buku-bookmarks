# Buku Bookmark Database

## Buku is a CLI program for creating and maintaining a personal database of bookmarks. Its's quite slick and I have enjoyed using it.  

## The tale of woe is not unlike many that have come before. I have kept backups and copies of my `bookmarks.html` file since the dawn of time. Each time I'd have to move to a new chassis or when, for instance,everything started changing and 
>  Netscape was no longer a thing and here came Firefox! Ooh wow, now another one called Chrome? That's cool..And then you have to go off to war, with a jumpdrive **FULL** of `bookmarks.html` files! When your buddy, Duke, was eventually gunned down, his last dying wish was that you bring his daughter his jump drive full of his history of interesting sites he came across. But most of his sites were exported from digg and stumbleupon, so Mandy, his daughter, didn't have a lot of wiggle room to extract her father's internet gems. 

## Oh, I'm sorry... I think I lost my thread of subject line. Buku, it means somekind of heart close tenderness thing. I fought for my bookmarks and goddamnit, I want them with me! 
  
##### I grew tired of manually porting the DB to and from my devices. After the last crash and subsequent corruption of the DB, I wised up and will now keep it tucked away here on the Hub of Git.
