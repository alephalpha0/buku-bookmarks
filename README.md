# Buku Bookmark Database

## Buku is a CLI program for creating and maintaining a personal database of bookmarks. Its's quite slick and I have enjoyed using it.  
  
##### I grew tired of manually porting the DB to and from my devices. After the last crash and subsequent corruption of the DB, I wised up and will now keep it tucked away here on the Hub of Git.
